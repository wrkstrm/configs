# Codex + Clia Onboarding

This guide helps new backend engineers and project managers connect to the Codex
and Clia systems while aligning with repository governance.

## Rationale

Connecting through documented steps ensures that every interaction can train
Codex and Clia and preserves a reliable history.

## Getting Started

1. **Request Access** – obtain Codex and Clia accounts before any work. See
   [Account Provisioning](PROVISIONING.md).
2. **Use the CLI** – run all tasks via the official command‑line tools to keep
   activity traceable.
3. **Avoid Manual Changes** – refrain from manual edits or UI actions to
   maintain consistent history.

## Expected Behavior

- Contributors request Codex and Clia accounts before starting work.
- All tasks are executed through the CLI; manual edits or UI actions are avoided.

## Workflow Improvements

Planned enhancements for this onboarding flow are tracked in separate docs:

- [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) – standardize scripts to bootstrap access and dependencies.
- [CLI_LOGGING.md](CLI_LOGGING.md) – automate capture of CLI commands and output.
- [MARKDOWN_LINT.md](MARKDOWN_LINT.md) – add a markdown lint pre‑commit hook.
- [PR_TEMPLATE.md](PR_TEMPLATE.md) – provide PR templates and checklists.
- [FAQ.md](FAQ.md) – collect solutions for common setup errors.
- [ONBOARDING_REVIEW.md](ONBOARDING_REVIEW.md) – outline quarterly review
  of this guide.
- [MENTORSHIP.md](MENTORSHIP.md) – pair new hires with a mentor to reinforce the flow.
